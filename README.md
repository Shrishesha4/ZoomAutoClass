# ZoomAutoLogin
This is a very basic python code which automates the process of joining and leaving the zoom meetings. 

# Requirements 
 - Put a random zoom link in your browser address bar and hit enter. Make sure to check [this](docs/image1.png) box and click open so you don't have to do it again and again after automating.
 - Make sure to disable [this](docs/image2.png) 'ask for confirmation while you exit a meeting' box in your zoom settings.
 - Always give time in 24hr format inside [data.py](data.py).
 
# Support
 - Make sure to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me23_XFV3OY) video on YouTube before reporting an issue.
